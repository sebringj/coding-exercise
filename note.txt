This API should be able to do the following:
--------------------------------------------
- connect to a database of your choice (MySQL, Postgres, MongoDB, SQLite, etc.) using knex.js
- handle CRUD actions for a Contact
- associate contacts to users
- filter contact collection by contact type
- filter contact collection by name or email
- detect duplicate contact and merge data

Extra mile:
-----------
- build a UI to perform CRUD actions on the API endpoints
- add a pub/sub endpoint that broadcasts the new score to all subscribers when a lead score is updated
- create a custom middleware that detects a header field (can be anything) that when set, only allows searching a contact
